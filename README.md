# Motor Unit Toolbox

## Overview 
This repository contains functions to analyse motor unit (MU) behaviour, from computing basic firing and motor unit action potential (MUAP) properties, to comparing sets of spike trains and tracking MUAPs.

## Installation 
To set up the project locally do the following:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/imendezguerra/motor_unit_toolbox.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd motor_unit_toolbox
    ```
3. Create the conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    ```sh
    conda activate motor_unit_toolbox
    ```
5. Install toolbox:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Quick start 
The package is composed of the following modules:
- `muap_comp.py`: Functions to compare and track MUAPs.
- `spike_comp.py`: Functions to compare spike trains between paired or unpaired sets, as well as within sets. Main metrics are rate of agreement, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, true positives, false positives, and false negatives.
- `props.py`: Functions to extract MU properties such as discharge rate, pulse to noise ratio, silhouette measure, and coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals, as well as MUAP features.
- `plots.py`: Functions to plot the spike trains, MUAPs, and grouped MUAPs.
